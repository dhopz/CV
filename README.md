## David Houpapa

I am a Software Developer recently graduated from Makers Academy with a background working as a Business Analyst for a variety of Fintech and Wealth Management Firms in the UK, New Zealand and Australia. I have lead projects on Corporate Onboarding, Income Producing Portfolios, Open Banking, Order Management System integrations and Property Investment Platforms. I also had exposure to Corporate Treasury, Foreign Exchange and Settlements prior to being a Professional Cricketer. I have a passion for technological innovation and my experience at Makers Academy has taught me the importance of best coding practices and how to deliver products iteratively and incrementally.
