I am a Software Developer recently graduated from Makers Academy with a background working as a Business Analyst for a variety of Fintech and Wealth Management Firms in the UK, New Zealand and Australia. 

My drive and enthusiasm for Code is driven by my desire to continually learn. Through out my professional career, my most rewarding moments have been when I have achieved a 'flow state' while working in VS Studio. I enjoy the problem-solving aspect, the research and exploration of new approaches that Software Development provides.

In my professional career I have had the opportunity to work in challenging and new environments. I have lead projects on Corporate Onboarding, Income Producing Portfolios, Open Banking, Order Management System Integrations and Property Investment Platforms. Prior to these roles, I used to work in Investment Banking Operations where I gained exposure to Corporate Treasury, Foreign Exchange and Settlements. 

I also have had the opportunity to play professional Cricket, playing with and against some of the world's best cricketers. My commitment to team ethos and success has been evident not only in my personal endeavours, but also my professional career. 

I have a passion for technological innovation and my experience at Makers Academy has taught me the importance of best coding practices and how to deliver products iteratively and incrementally.
